Object.cpp
Updated and tweaked the player shooting method.

Apocalypse:
Before, the challenge involved two players either trying to stay alive or take each other down for 180 seconds.</br>
Frankly, it was kind of counterintuitive, so I overhauled it.</br>
Players now have the option of working together to take down a common enemy, but they need to be careful not to get each other killed!.</br>
Of course, the harder you hit the boss, the more bullets you send over, so teamwork is key here.</br>
